Hibernate

Hibernate facilitated the storage and retrieval of Java domain objects via Object/Relational Mapping.Hibernate is a collection of related projects enabling developers to utilize POJO-style domain models in their applications in ways extending well beyond Object/Relational Mapping.

The Steps:
  1.Download Hibernate Libs and add to Project.
    https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/
    (create a folder called "lib" in the project. Extract the downloaded Hibernate Libraries. There's a folder called lib and in that folder there's another folder called     "required". Copy and paste those libraries to the lib folder in the project.)
  2.Also add JDBC Driver (Depends Database).
